## Wallet Lifecycle

### 1. Wallet Creation

```
Trigger: User account created (Advertiser or Supplier)

Process:
1. Create wallet automatically:
   Wallet.create(
     user_id: new_user.id,
     user_type: new_user.type, // ADVERTISER or SUPPLIER
     currency: new_user.country.default_currency OR "USD",
     available_balance: 0.00,
     held_balance: 0.00,
     pending_balance: 0.00,
     status: ACTIVE
   )

2. Initialize transaction log:
   WalletTransaction.create(
     wallet_id: wallet.id,
     transaction_type: ADJUSTMENT_CREDIT,
     amount: 0.00,
     balance_before: 0.00,
     balance_after: 0.00,
     description: "Wallet initialized",
     status: COMPLETED
   )

3. Set default limits:
   IF user_type = ADVERTISER:
     wallet.max_balance_limit = 100,000.00 // $100k max
     wallet.min_balance_alert = 100.00    // Alert below $100
   ELSE IF user_type = SUPPLIER:
     wallet.max_balance_limit = null       // No limit
     wallet.min_balance_alert = 1,000.00  // Alert below $1k

Business Rules:
- One wallet per user (strict 1:1 relationship)
- Created automatically at user registration
- Initial balance always 0.00
- Currency based on user's country (default: USD)
- Status = ACTIVE by default
- Immutable after creation (cannot delete wallet)
```

---

## Business Rules

### Rule 1: Balance Management

#### 1.1 Balance Types

**Available Balance**:
```
Definition: Funds immediately usable for campaigns or withdrawals

For Advertisers:
- Can create campaigns using available balance
- Available = deposited funds not escrowed

For Suppliers:
- Can withdraw available balance
- Available = revenue earned and released (not held)

Business Rules:
- Never negative (enforced by database constraint)
- Increased by: deposits, refunds, released holds
- Decreased by: campaign holds, withdrawals, fees
```

**Held Balance**:
```
Definition: Funds temporarily locked for pending operations

For Advertisers:
- Campaign budget escrowed when campaign created
- Released when campaign completes or cancelled

For Suppliers:
- Revenue held during 7-day anti-fraud period
- Disputed impressions held until resolved

Business Rules:
- Never negative
- Increased by: campaign creation, disputes
- Decreased by: campaign completion, dispute resolution
- Automatic release after holding period
```

**Pending Balance**:
```
Definition: Funds in-flight (processing deposits/withdrawals)

For Advertisers:
- Deposit processing (1-3 days for bank transfer)
- Moves to available_balance when cleared

For Suppliers:
- Withdrawal processing (3-5 days)
- Removed from wallet when wire sent

Business Rules:
- Never negative
- Temporary state (max 7 days)
- Alerts if pending > 7 days (investigation needed)
- Refunded if payment fails
```

#### 1.2 Balance Invariants

```
Invariant 1: Non-negative balances
available_balance >= 0
held_balance >= 0
pending_balance >= 0

Invariant 2: Total balance accuracy
total_balance = available_balance + held_balance + pending_balance

Invariant 3: Transaction sum equals balance
total_balance == SUM(all transactions.net_amount)

Invariant 4: Advertiser balance matches campaigns
advertiser.held_balance == SUM(active_campaigns.remaining_budget)

Validation:
IF any invariant violated:
  CRITICAL_ERROR: "Balance integrity violation"
  FREEZE wallet
  ALERT finance team
  TRIGGER manual reconciliation
```

---

### Rule 2: Top-up Processing

#### 2.1 Top-up Limits

```
Per-transaction Limits:
- Minimum top-up: $50.00
- Maximum top-up: $10,000.00 per transaction
- Maximum daily total: $50,000.00

Account-based Limits:
- Unverified account: Max $500/day
- Verified account: Max $10,000/day
- Enterprise account: Custom limits

Frequency Limits:
- Max 10 transactions per day
- Cooldown: 1 minute between transactions

Validation:
IF top_up_amount < 50:
  ERROR: "Minimum top-up is $50"

IF top_up_amount > 10,000:
  ERROR: "Maximum top-up is $10,000 per transaction"

IF daily_total + top_up_amount > daily_limit:
  ERROR: "Daily limit exceeded"

IF transactions_today >= 10:
  ERROR: "Maximum 10 transactions per day"

Business Rules:
- Limits adjustable per account tier
- Enterprise accounts get custom limits
- Suspicious patterns flagged for review
- Repeated limit hits trigger AML review
```

#### 2.2 Top-up Flow

```
Actor: Advertiser
Payment Methods: Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer

Process:
1. User initiates top-up:
   POST /wallet/topup
   {
     "amount": 500.00,
     "payment_method_id": "pm_xxx",
     "save_payment_method": true
   }

2. Validation:
   ✓ amount >= $50 AND <= $10,000
   ✓ daily_limit not exceeded
   ✓ payment_method valid and active
   ✓ wallet status = ACTIVE (not frozen)

3. Create pending transaction:
   transaction = WalletTransaction.create(
     wallet_id: wallet.id,
     transaction_type: PENDING_DEPOSIT,
     amount: 500.00,
     status: PENDING,
     payment_method: CREDIT_CARD,
     payment_gateway: STRIPE,
     description: "Top-up via Stripe"
   )

   wallet.pending_balance += 500.00

4. Process payment via gateway:
   // Stripe example
   payment_intent = Stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
     amount: 50000, // cents
     currency: "usd",
     payment_method: payment_method_id,
     confirm: true
   )

5. Handle gateway response:

   Success (payment_intent.status = "succeeded"):
     wallet.pending_balance -= 500.00
     wallet.available_balance += 500.00

     transaction.update(
       status: COMPLETED,
       gateway_transaction_id: payment_intent.id,
       processed_at: NOW()
     )

     WalletTransaction.create(
       transaction_type: DEPOSIT,
       amount: 500.00,
       balance_before: previous_available,
       balance_after: wallet.available_balance,
       balance_type_affected: AVAILABLE,
       status: COMPLETED
     )

     Notify user: "Top-up successful: $500"

   Failure (payment_intent.status = "failed"):
     wallet.pending_balance -= 500.00
     // Refund pending amount

     transaction.update(
       status: FAILED,
       processed_at: NOW()
     )

     Notify user: "Top-up failed: {error_message}"

   Requires Action (3D Secure):
     // Return URL for user authentication
     Return {
       status: "requires_action",
       client_secret: payment_intent.client_secret
     }
     // User completes 3DS, webhook processes result

6. AML check (if applicable):
   IF amount >= 1,000 OR suspicious_pattern:
     flag_for_aml_review(transaction)

Business Rules:
- Payment processed via Stripe/PayPal
- 3D Secure required for cards (European regulation)
- Pending → Available when payment clears
- Failed payments refund pending balance
- All transactions logged (immutable)
- User notified of outcome (email + push)
```

---

### Rule 3: Campaign Budget Hold

```
Trigger: Campaign created with budget

Process:
1. Validate available balance:
   IF wallet.available_balance < campaign.budget:
     ERROR: "Insufficient balance"
     Prompt user to top-up

2. Create hold transaction:
   WalletTransaction.create(
     transaction_type: CAMPAIGN_HOLD,
     amount: campaign.budget,
     reference_type: "Campaign",
     reference_id: campaign.id,
     description: "Budget hold for campaign: {campaign.name}",
     status: COMPLETED
   )

3. Move funds: available → held
   wallet.available_balance -= campaign.budget
   wallet.held_balance += campaign.budget

4. Campaign lifecycle impacts:

   On impression recorded:
     // Deduct from held balance
     impression_cost = calculate_cost(impression)

     wallet.held_balance -= impression_cost
     // Not added to available (consumed)

     WalletTransaction.create(
       transaction_type: CAMPAIGN_CHARGE,
       amount: impression_cost,
       reference_type: "Impression",
       reference_id: impression.id,
       description: "Impression cost",
       status: COMPLETED
     )

     campaign.spent += impression_cost
     campaign.remaining_budget -= impression_cost

   On campaign completion:
     // Release unused budget
     unused_budget = campaign.remaining_budget

     IF unused_budget > 0:
       wallet.held_balance -= unused_budget
       wallet.available_balance += unused_budget

       WalletTransaction.create(
         transaction_type: RELEASE,
         amount: unused_budget,
         reference_type: "Campaign",
         reference_id: campaign.id,
         description: "Unused budget released",
         status: COMPLETED
       )

   On campaign cancellation:
     // Full refund
     wallet.held_balance -= campaign.remaining_budget
     wallet.available_balance += campaign.remaining_budget

     WalletTransaction.create(
       transaction_type: REFUND,
       amount: campaign.remaining_budget,
       reference_type: "Campaign",
       reference_id: campaign.id,
       description: "Campaign cancelled - budget refunded",
       status: COMPLETED
     )

Business Rules:
- Budget hold is atomic (all-or-nothing)
- Held balance cannot be used for other campaigns
- Impression costs deducted from held balance
- Unused budget automatically released
- Cancellation = full refund of remaining budget
- Hold/release transactions logged
```

---

### Rule 4: Supplier Revenue & Payout

#### 4.1 Revenue Accrual

```
Trigger: Impression verified

Process:
1. Calculate supplier share:
   impression_cost = 0.08 // Example
   platform_share = impression_cost × 0.20 = 0.016
   supplier_share = impression_cost × 0.80 = 0.064

2. Credit supplier wallet (held):
   supplier_wallet.held_balance += supplier_share

   WalletTransaction.create(
     transaction_type: REVENUE,
     amount: supplier_share,
     balance_type_affected: HELD,
     reference_type: "Impression",
     reference_id: impression.id,
     description: "Revenue from impression",
     status: COMPLETED
   )

3. Hold period: 7 days (anti-fraud)
   scheduled_release_date = impression.created_at + 7 days

4. After 7 days (no disputes):
   supplier_wallet.held_balance -= supplier_share
   supplier_wallet.available_balance += supplier_share

   WalletTransaction.create(
     transaction_type: RELEASE,
     amount: supplier_share,
     description: "Revenue released after hold period",
     status: COMPLETED
   )

5. If disputed within 7 days:
   // Revenue stays in held_balance
   // If dispute upheld (chargeback):
     supplier_wallet.held_balance -= supplier_share
     // Deducted (lost revenue)

     WalletTransaction.create(
       transaction_type: CHARGEBACK,
       amount: supplier_share,
       reference_type: "Dispute",
       reference_id: dispute.id,
       description: "Chargeback for disputed impression",
       status: COMPLETED
     )

Business Rules:
- Revenue credited immediately but held
- 7-day hold period for fraud prevention
- Auto-release after hold period
- Disputed revenue held until resolved
- Chargebacks deducted from held balance
- Supplier can see held vs available clearly
```

#### 4.2 Supplier Withdrawal

```
Actor: Supplier
Frequency: Anytime (with limits)

Requirements:
- Minimum withdrawal: $50.00
- Available balance >= withdrawal amount + fee
- Bank account verified
- No pending disputes

Withdrawal Fee:
- < $500: $5 fee
- $500-$5,000: $10 fee
- > $5,000: $25 fee

Tax Withholding (US suppliers):
- W9 on file: No withholding
- No W9: 24% backup withholding

Process:
1. Supplier requests withdrawal:
   POST /wallet/withdraw
   {
     "amount": 1000.00,
     "bank_account_id": "ba_xxx"
   }

2. Validation:
   ✓ amount >= $50
   ✓ wallet.available_balance >= amount + fee
   ✓ bank_account verified
   ✓ no_pending_disputes
   ✓ wallet status = ACTIVE

3. Calculate fees and tax:
   withdrawal_amount = 1000.00
   fee = 10.00 // $500-$5k tier
   tax = has_w9 ? 0.00 : (1000.00 × 0.24) = 240.00
   net_amount = 1000.00 - 10.00 - 240.00 = 750.00

4. Create withdrawal request:
   WithdrawalRequest.create(
     wallet_id: wallet.id,
     supplier_id: supplier.id,
     amount: 1000.00,
     fee_amount: 10.00,
     tax_amount: 240.00,
     net_amount: 750.00,
     bank_account_name: "John Doe",
     bank_account_number: "***1234",
     bank_routing_number: "123456789",
     status: PENDING
   )

5. Lock funds:
   wallet.available_balance -= 1000.00
   wallet.pending_balance += 1000.00

## Tax Handling

### Rule 7: Tax Calculation & Withholding

#### 7.1 Sales Tax (for Advertisers)

```
Applicability:
- US-based advertisers: State sales tax on ad spending
- EU-based advertisers: VAT on services
- Other regions: As per local tax law

Tax Rate Determination:
- Based on advertiser billing address

tax_rate = get_tax_rate(advertiser.billing_address) // e.g., 8.25%
tax_amount = 1000.00 × 0.0825 = 82.50
total_charge = 1000.00 + 82.50 = 1082.50

// User pays total_charge
// Campaign budget = 1000.00 (pre-tax)
// Tax remitted to authorities

WalletTransaction.create(
  transaction_type: TAX_WITHHOLDING,
  amount: 82.50,
  description: "Sales tax (8.25%)",
  metadata: {
    tax_type: "SALES_TAX",
    tax_rate: 0.0825,
    jurisdiction: "California"
  }

supplier_revenue = 1000.00

IF supplier.has_w9:
  withholding = 0.00
ELSE IF supplier.country = "US":
  withholding = 1000.00 × 0.24 = 240.00
ELSE IF supplier.country IN tax_treaty_countries:
  withholding = 1000.00 × treaty_rate
ELSE:
  withholding = 1000.00 × 0.30 = 300.00

net_payout = 1000.00 - withholding

WalletTransaction.create(
  transaction_type: TAX_WITHHOLDING,
  amount: withholding,
  description: "Tax withholding (24%)",
  metadata: {
    tax_type: "BACKUP_WITHHOLDING",
    tax_rate: 0.24
  }
)

// Supplier receives net_payout
// Withholding remitted to IRS

Year-end Reporting:
- 1099 forms issued to US suppliers
- 1042-S forms issued to non-US suppliers

## Financial Reconciliation

### Rule 8: Daily Reconciliation

```
Schedule: Daily at 00:00 UTC

Purpose: Verify financial accuracy

Process:
1. Calculate expected totals:
   expected_balance = (
     opening_balance +
     total_deposits -
     total_withdrawals -
     total_fees
   )

2. Calculate actual totals:
   actual_balance = SUM(
     wallet.available_balance +
     wallet.held_balance +
     wallet.pending_balance
     FOR ALL wallets
   )

3. Compare:
   discrepancy = expected_balance - actual_balance

4. Validate transactions:
   transaction_sum = SUM(
     transactions.net_amount
     WHERE date = yesterday
   )

   IF transaction_sum != (deposits - withdrawals - fees):
     FLAG discrepancy

5. Record reconciliation:
   DailyReconciliation.create(
     reconciliation_date: yesterday,
     total_deposits: deposits,
     total_withdrawals: withdrawals,
     expected_balance: expected_balance,
     actual_balance: actual_balance,
     discrepancy: discrepancy,
     status: discrepancy == 0 ? BALANCED : DISCREPANCY
   )

6. Alert if discrepancy:
   IF abs(discrepancy) > 0.01: // > 1 cent
     send_alert(finance_team, "Reconciliation discrepancy: ${discrepancy}")
     require_investigation()

7. Investigation:
   - Review all transactions for yesterday
   - Check for failed/pending transactions
   - Verify gateway webhooks received
   - Check for race conditions
   - Manual audit if needed

8. Resolution:
   IF discrepancy_resolved:
     DailyReconciliation.update(
       status: RESOLVED,
       discrepancy_reason: explanation,
       reconciled_by: admin.id,
       reconciled_at: NOW()
     )

Business Rules:
- Reconciliation runs daily automatically
- Discrepancies investigated immediately
- Tolerate ±$0.01 (rounding errors)
- Larger discrepancies halt operations until resolved
- All reconciliations auditable
- Monthly reconciliation aggregates daily results
```

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

### Rule 9: AML Compliance

#### 9.1 Transaction Monitoring

```
Suspicious Activity Indicators:

1. Large Single Transactions:
   IF deposit >= $10,000:
     flag_for_aml_review("Large deposit")

2. Structuring (Smurfing):
   deposits_today = SUM(deposits WHERE date = today)
   IF deposits_today >= $10,000:
     AND max_single_deposit < $5,000:
       flag_for_aml_review("Possible structuring")

3. Rapid In-and-Out:
   IF deposit_today > $5,000:
     AND withdrawal_within_24h > $4,000:
       flag_for_aml_review("Rapid in-and-out")

4. Unusual Pattern:
   IF typical_monthly_deposit < $1,000:
     AND current_deposit > $10,000:
       flag_for_aml_review("Unusual pattern")

5. High-Risk Jurisdiction:
   IF user.country IN high_risk_countries:
     flag_for_aml_review("High-risk jurisdiction")

Action on Flag:
1. Transaction held (pending_balance)
2. Compliance team notified
3. Request additional documentation:
   - Source of funds
   - Business justification
   - Identity verification
4. Review within 24-48 hours
5. Approve or reject

Approval:
  Release funds to available_balance
  Clear flag

Rejection:

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1: Concurrent Top-ups

```
Scenario: User submits 2 top-ups simultaneously

Race Condition:
  Transaction A: Top-up $500
  Transaction B: Top-up $500
  Daily limit: $1,000

Without locking:
  Both check daily_total = $0
  Both proceed (total = $1,000) → OK
  But if Transaction C also: total = $1,500 → VIOLATION

Solution: Database-level locking
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT available_balance FROM wallets
WHERE id = X
FOR UPDATE; // Row-level lock

daily_total = get_daily_total_with_lock(user_id)
IF daily_total + amount > daily_limit:
  ROLLBACK;
  ERROR: "Daily limit exceeded"
ELSE:
  wallet.available_balance += amount
  COMMIT;

Business Rule:
- Use row-level locks for balance updates
- Atomic operations (all-or-nothing)
- Retry failed transactions (exponential backoff)
```

### Edge Case 2: Payment Gateway Webhook Delay

```
Scenario: Payment succeeds but webhook delayed

Timeline:
  T+0s: User submits top-up
  T+1s: Payment successful at Stripe
  T+2s: Pending transaction created
  T+3600s: Webhook arrives (1 hour delay)

Problem: User's balance shows pending for 1 hour

Solution: Webhook + Polling Hybrid
1. Create pending transaction immediately
2. Poll payment status every 30 seconds (timeout: 5 min)
3. If status = succeeded:
     Process immediately (don't wait for webhook)
4. Webhook serves as backup/confirmation

Business Rule:
- Poll for 5 minutes max
- Webhook is source of truth (overrides poll if conflict)
- Alert if webhook not received within 1 hour
```

### Edge Case 3: Withdrawal Bank Account Closed

```
Scenario: Supplier's bank account closed, withdrawal fails

Process:
1. Withdrawal initiated:
   wallet.available_balance -= 1000
   wallet.pending_balance += 1000

2. Bank transfer attempted
3. Bank returns error: "Account closed"

4. Handle failure:
   wallet.pending_balance -= 1000
   wallet.available_balance += 1000

   withdrawal_request.update(
     status: FAILED,
     failure_reason: "Bank account closed"
   )

   Notify supplier: "Withdrawal failed - please update bank account"

5. Supplier updates bank account
6. Retry withdrawal

Business Rule:
- Failed withdrawals refunded automatically
- User notified with specific reason
- Can retry after updating bank info
- Max 3 retry attempts
- After 3 failures: manual intervention required
```

## Validation Rules

### Wallet Validation Matrix

| Field | Rule | Error Message |
|-------|------|---------------|
| amount | > 0 | "Amount must be positive" |
| amount | Max 2 decimals | "Amount cannot have more than 2 decimal places" |
| top_up_amount | >= $50 | "Minimum top-up is $50" |
| top_up_amount | <= $10,000 | "Maximum top-up is $10,000 per transaction" |
| withdrawal_amount | >= $50 | "Minimum withdrawal is $50" |
| withdrawal_amount | <= available_balance | "Insufficient balance" |
| currency | ISO 4217 code | "Invalid currency code" |
| balance | >= 0 | "Balance cannot be negative" |

---

## Calculations & Formulas

### Formula Summary

#### 1. Total Balance
```
total_balance = available_balance + held_balance + pending_balance

Must equal: SUM(all transactions.net_amount)
```

#### 2. Net Transaction Amount
```
net_amount = amount - fee_amount - tax_amount

Example:
  Withdrawal: $1,000
  Fee: $10
  Tax: $240
  Net: $1,000 - $10 - $240 = $750
```

#### 3. Supplier Revenue Share
```
supplier_revenue = impression_cost × 0.80
platform_revenue = impression_cost × 0.20

Example:
  Impression cost: $0.10
  Supplier: $0.08
  Platform: $0.02
```

#### 4. Daily Reconciliation
```
expected_balance = (
  opening_balance +
  SUM(deposits) -
  SUM(withdrawals) -
  SUM(fees) -
  SUM(taxes)
)

discrepancy = expected_balance - actual_balance

Acceptable if: abs(discrepancy) <= $0.01
```

#### 5. Withdrawal Fee
```
fee = CASE withdrawal_amount
  WHEN < $500: $5
  WHEN $500-$5,000: $10
  WHEN > $5,000: $25
```

#### 6. Tax Withholding
```
US supplier without W-9:
  withholding = amount × 0.24

Non-US supplier without treaty:
  withholding = amount × 0.30

With treaty:
  withholding = amount × treaty_rate
```

## Appendix: Transaction Examples

### Example 1: Complete Top-up Flow
```
Initial state:
  available_balance: $100.00

1. User tops up $500:
   pending_balance += $500 → $500.00
   Transaction: PENDING_DEPOSIT, $500

2. Payment clears:
   pending_balance -= $500 → $0.00
   available_balance += $500 → $600.00
   Transaction: DEPOSIT, $500
